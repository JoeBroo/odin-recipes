    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li>12 English muffins</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>12 slices ham (heated)</li>
        <li>12 slices cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Split English muffins and lay on a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Rub butter into each cavity of a 12-cup muffin tin, then crack an egg into each cavity. Break the yolks unless you want them runny.</li>
        <li>Place English muffins and eggs in preheated oven on separate racks. Toast muffins until golden brown, about 3 minutes, then remove. Bake eggs until set, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lift eggs out of pan with a spatula and place on the English muffins. Top with ham and cheddar cheese. Serve hot.</li>
        <li> If you're not serving it right away, you can put it in the freezer and save it for later.</li>
