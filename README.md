Recipe project for TOP

This project is about making a basic recipe website with HTML.

It consists of a main index page with a few links to different recipes.

By the end of this project I hope to have demonstrated the following skills:

> Displaying lists
> Linking to different websites
> Using various tags and elements
> Inserting Images
